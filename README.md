# My Rust Journey: Guessing Game

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I'm embarking on my Rust development journey by building the classic **Guessing Game** exercise from *The Rust Programming Language* book. This repo showcases my first steps into Rust, focusing on learning its syntax, ownership model, and error handling through a simple, interactive command-line game.

## About the Guessing Game
The Guessing Game is a beginner-friendly project from *The Rust Programming Language* (often called "The Book"), a comprehensive guide to learning Rust. In this exercise, the program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it. The program provides hints ("Too high" or "Too low") until the correct number is guessed. Key Rust concepts covered include:

- **Variables and Mutability**: Using `let` and `mut` for variable bindings.
- **Control Flow**: Implementing loops and conditionals.
- **Input/Output**: Handling user input via `std::io`.
- **Error Handling**: Using `match` and `Result` for robust code.
- **Random Number Generation**: Leveraging the `rand` crate.

This project serves as a foundation for understanding Rust's safety guarantees and performance-oriented design.

## My Goal
Through this exercise, I'm learning the fundamentals of Rust to build reliable and efficient software. This repository captures my progress as I explore Rust's unique features, starting with the Guessing Game and aiming to tackle more complex projects in the future.

## Repository Contents
- **Source Code**: The Guessing Game implementation in `src/main.rs`.
- **Notes**: Key Rust concepts and lessons learned.
- **Resources**: Links to *The Rust Programming Language* book and relevant documentation.
